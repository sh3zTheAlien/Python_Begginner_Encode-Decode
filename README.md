Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder
A Caesar Cipher tool written in Python that allows users to encode and decode messages using one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. This program shifts each letter in a message by a specified number of positions, making it a fun example of basic encryption in Python.

Features
Encoding and Decoding: Encrypts messages by shifting letters forward and decrypts by shifting them back.
Custom Shift Key: Users can specify the number of positions to shift each letter, allowing for different encryption keys.
Alphabet Wrap-around: Handles the alphabet wrap-around seamlessly, so 'z' followed by a shift becomes 'a' and vice versa.
Case Insensitivity: Works with both uppercase and lowercase input without issues
